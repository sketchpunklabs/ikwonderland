# What is Skinning?

A technical definition can be : a method of deforming a mesh in relation to a skeletal structure. Not to be confused by what a taxidermist does on the job :P

With techno babel & jokes aside, skinning is the general term used when we want to talk about the mechanics of how to simulate movement of a 3D characters. Skinning has 2 parts, a skin & a skeleton. You can easily look at it like any living creature which has skin that gives you the outer appearence which hides all the muscles & bones that helps move it move around.

The skin part is just a 3D model aka mesh. For the newbies, a mesh is just a big pile of triangles that come together to form voltron :). On its own, a mesh is just a virtual statue that just stands there occupying space, doing nothing but look pretty or menacing.

The skeleton part is really just a big pile of scary mathmatical soup that when computed and applied, moves & rotates all these triangles. The idea is that when you move these virtual bones around, the mesh will deform itself so it looks like it's actually moving. Emphasis on **"looks like"**, because all its doing is trying to simulate real world movement in a virtual enviroment.

In conclusion, skinning is just a way in which we are able to make characters walk, make cannons aim or generally just bending a mesh to our will.
